Red Imperium is a 4X space game inspired by Missile Madness, Twilight Imperium, Galactic Empire, Civilization, Catan and other hex-based games of colonization and conquest. The game is similar to its counterparts in its use of hexagonal movement, strategy cards, a technology tree and a command-counter system that restricts the flexibility of player moves and forces trade-offs between different activities. 
It differs in its embrace of streamlined gameplay mechanics that preserve the social aspects of the game while enabling faster real-time play, and the use of cryptographically-secured underlying technologies to bring social aspects securely into a real-time group board game.
