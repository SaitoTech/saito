           Paths of Glory 10.6
    </h1>
    <p>
The Paths of Glory 10 project was led by <b>Brian Reynolds</b>. None of it 
would be possible without the efforts of <b>Joel Koepp</b>, who led most of the 
module 7.0/8.0 efforts which formed the backbone of all that followed. 
<b>Claudio Ciardelli</b>, who built 9.0, added the Deluxe Historical map, 
snazzier card decks, and pushed forward with automation features. Brian Reynolds
then took over and built 9.2 through 9.9 incorporating the rest of the 2018
Deluxe Edition art assets, adding RB/Eliminated box organization and 
RB-counting, automatic corps-army substitution, VP site control and scoring, 
automated AR markers, improved logfile reporting, and continued bug-fixing and 
polish. <b>Javier Munoz Kirshberg</b> supplied a full Spanish translation (and a lot of work
to help clean up VASSAL to support localization properly). <b>Jim Hunter</b> did a 
major tune-up on Movement Trails for 10.6. Special Thanks to Pranas Pauliukonis 
who did a thorough round of testing for the 9.3 and 9.4 versions, to Tom Gregorio for providing 
veteran-player feedback, to Michael Kiefte who shared his Chess Clock source code from Twilight
Struggle, and also to Bill Thomson who integrated Paul Blankenship's "LookAt" feature - original code 
credited to David Sullivan - which ultimately went on to become the "Flare" feature of VASSAL itself. 
Thanks also to everyone who has contributed to the module over the years, including Davout, Kaiman, Pmanlig, 
ampercival, and egg_salad! <br> <br>The module is presently maintained by 
<b>Brian Reynolds</b> - please report any problems to 
<b>brian@brianreynolds.net</b>.

    <h2>1. First Things First</h2>
    <p>
Under the <b>"Help"</b> menu you will find a link to the latest <b>Living 
Rules</b> version of the Paths of Glory rulebook, in case you are still learning 
how to play the game itself, or just need to "look up a rule". A nice "Rules 
Overview" video that uses the latest version of the game can also be found here:
<i></i>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHMr-gu1u1c</i>
                                                          <br><br>
        Meanwhile if you've played using earlier versions of the module and just 
        want to check out the latest list of changes, please see the <b>"Change
        List"</b> from the Help Menu of the module. <br><br>

        <b>Advanced Players</b> should page through and take in the latest 
        capabilities of the module! It may have changed a lot since the last 
        time you checked it out!
        <br><br>
    This version of the Paths of Glory module aims to incorporate the graphics
    from the latest release of the physical game, including all of the artwork
    from the Deluxe 2018 edition, along with considerable play enhancements, 
    interface improvements, and automation. We hope you enjoy it!

<h2>2. Setting Up</h2> 
<p> The latest 2018 rulebook includes two scenarios - the <b>Historical Scenario</b>
used in most competitive play and the <b>Campaign Scenario</b> representing more
closely the "classic" original rules. You can choose to play the Historical
Scenario either on the original "classic" map by Mark Simonitch or the new
"deluxe" map by Terry Leeds. The original Campaign Scenario is only supported on
the classic map.

    <br>
<h2>3. Choosing a Side</h2> 
    <p> The side you choose gives you access to its hand of cards--or choose
Solitaire to have access to both (also useful for local play on one computer,
and for PBEM play via ACTS). For players and competitive events in need of
security for cards and dice rolls, it is recommended to use ACTS or a similar
server -- the Vassal client by itself cannot provide meaningful security.</p>

<h2>4. Cards</h2>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Players using ACTS can skip straight to section 5 on Units 
and Markers. 
        <br><br>To reduce window clutter, card decks have been placed on the main 
map below the board. Cards can be drawn through several methods, including 
right-clicking on the draw pile, the "draw" button below each draw pile, and 
"Draw Cards" buttons located on the toolbar ribbon of both the main window and 
the player hand windows.

<br><br>

<img src="goasmall.png">

<br> 
<b>Guns of August, Historical Scenario: </b>If you start the Historical Scenario 
(on either map), the Guns of August card will have been played automatically to 
start the game -- the appropriate German Armies will already have activation 
markers placed, the Liege fort will be destroyed, etc. The CP player should thus 
draw one fewer card than normal when filling their hand for turn 1.
        <br><br>
        <b>Guns of August, Classic Scenario: </b>If you start the Classic 
        Scenario, the Guns of August card will begin in the discard pile. The CP 
        player may either take it into their hand (open the CP Hand window from
        the toolbar and drag the card into the window) or right click on it and 
        select "Reshuffle" to shuffle it into the deck. At this point the CP 
        player should draw cards to fill their hand to the correct hand size.

        <br>
            <img src="expansion4.png"><b>Optional Cards:</b> Instead of 
creating several scenarios that include/exclude the Optional cards, they are in 
their own labeled decks for inclusion if you wish. The window containing them
can be opened either by clicking the "Optional" button on the toolbar (see icon
to the left), or by clicking on the "Optional Cards" button in the center of the
card-play area below the gameboard.
        <br><br> Once the optional cards window is open, click the "Add to Game"
        buttons below each deck to automatically add the Optional cards to their 
        respective decks. You can also choose to fish out specific cards and 
        then add them to their appropriate decks manually if you wish to play 
        with an agreed subset. Once the desired optional cards have been added 
        to the appropriate decks, play can proceed normally.

<br><br>
<img src="play-a-card.png">

        <br>
            <b>Playing Cards:</b> Select a card in your hand, right click,
                and choose from: Play as Event (Ctrl-E), Play for OPS (Ctrl-O),
                Play for RPs (Ctrl-R), Play for SR (Ctrl-S). Combat Cards also
                have these options: Play as Combat Card (Ctrl-C), or Discard
                (Ctrl-D). Combat Cards get played to locations below the game
                map. Events that adjust War Status or VPs will modify those 
                values automatically. Some of the options are greyed out or 
                removed based on the game status (Ex: Play as Event is not 
                available on Turn 1 for Reinforcements events). 
<br><br>
<img src="play-a-reinf.png">

        <br>


            <b>Reinforcement Cards:</b> Reinforcement events for e.g. AH, FR,
            GE, RU now allow the destination to be selected when the event is
            played. For the occasional situation where it is desired to play a
            two-army reinforcement card (e.g. GE 17th and 18th armies) split 
            between two spaces, simply event the card to one location and then 
            move one of the armies manually to the other. This was judged more 
            desirable than giving cards a vast menu of split deployment options.

<h2>5. Units and Markers</h2> 
        <p>
        Control markers, forts, trenches, armies/corps, 
and the various map markers (Attack/Move markers, etc) are separated into 
different game piece layers to prevent accidental movement and stacking. The 
drawing order from bottom to top is: Forts, Control Markers, Trenches, Units 
(armies/corps), then everything else. Units placed in a space will stack with 
other units there (double click to expand a stack so that individual pieces can 
be clicked on). Trenches and other markers do not "stack" and can therefore be 
dragged/adjusted around for better visibility. From 9.2 forward, an effort has 
been made to make hotkeys consistent across various counter types (e.g. Ctrl+F 
is always the "Flip"), and to have counters "flip" to the same back-side as 
they'd have in the physical game (so e.g. control markers can be flipped AP/CP). 

            <br><br>
              <img src="palette sample.png">
            <br>
            The <b>Markers</b> can be found on the toolbar, and opens a 
            "palette" window to open to the left of the chat log. All of the 
            common markers (e.g. trenches, control markers) can be found here in 
            infinite supply, and can be dragged to the map as needed. A separate 
            tab also makes available VP markers for various situations.

            src="removesample.png">
<br>
            <b>Activation Markers:</b> With any unit OR stack selected, you can use
Ctrl+M or Ctrl+A to activate the stack for movement or attack (you can also
right click). All activation markers can be removed by the toolbar button, and
are also removed when the turn is advanced.

            <img src="ops example.png">
        <br>
            <b>Operations count:</b> An appropriate count of operations will be 
            maintained as stacks are activated. Multinational stacks, for 
            example, will be charged extra ops to activate per rule 9.2.3. 
            However appropriate exceptions will be made for e.g. Sud Army, 11th 
            Army, British/Belgian cooperation, French/US cooperation. Likewise 
            appropriate additional costs will be assessed for e.g. Moltke and 
            attacking during Fall of the Tsar when those events are in effect.

<h2>6. Scoring, War Status, and Events</h2>
        <p>
            Event markers have now been provided for all events that either 
            affect War Status, award VP's, or produce lingering game effects 
            that need notation (e.g. Entrench, Moltke, etc). When an event 
            marker is placed on the map or turn track, both the War Status and the VP level will be automatically 
            adjusted as appropriate (they can also be adjusted manually if 
            desired).
            <br><br>
            When a card is "played for the event" with the normal live-play or 
            PBEM interface, the event marker will be placed on the turn track 
            automatically. When playing via ACTS, the event markers for each 
            side can be found on the reinforcement card screens for each side.
            
            <br><br>
            <img src="blockade_event.png"> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img 
            src="vp_1_blockade.png"> <br> 
            <b>Blockade: </b>Once the Blockade event is played (or its marker
            placed on the turn track), appropriate -1 VP markers will be added
            to the turn track automatically at each Winter turn, and the VP
            level adjusted accordingly. <b>NOTE:</b> Although Blockade VP's are 
            formally supposed to be added during "War Status Phase" at the 
            <i>end</i> of each turn, that is also the only time that VP's are 
            actually checked for victory purposes. For technical and interface 
            reasons, a Blockade VP marker will be placed at the beginning of 
            each Winter turn (or at the moment the event is played if the event 
            is played during the turn) - but as long as this is understood it 
            will not affect gameplay since autovictory is checked only at the 
            end of each turn.

            <br><br>

            <img src="control example.png">
            <br>

                <b>Control Markers and Scoring: </b>Control markers are now automatically placed when units capture spaces by moving into them, but they can also be dragged from the markers window. When control markers are
                    placed in (or moved to, or deleted from) VP sites, the VP
                    level is automatically adjusted. In the event the VP marker
                    has been manually dragged, the correct VP level (based on
                    current control markers, and any event/vp markers presently
                    on the map or turn track) can be recalculated by
                    right-clicking on the VP marker or from the VP button on the
                    main toolbar.

            <br><br>
            <img src="victory summary.png"> <br>

                <b>Final Scoring: </b>By right clicking the VP marker, or
                    from the VP button on the main toolbar, it is possible to
                    calculate Final Scoring using the current map conditions. If
                    the game has not yet reached the end of turn 20 and the
                    combined war status is below the Armistice level of 40, it
                    is still perfectly safe to use the button to compute
                    "hypothetical" final scoring.

<br><br> 
<img src="action round sample.png">
<br>
         
<h2>7. Placing Action Round markers</h2> 
        <p> At start, and after turn advance, the Action Round markers are 
            positioned near the Action Round chart. When cards are played the AR 
            markers will <b>automatically</b> place themselves on the chart to 
            appropriate locations (e.g. "Ops", "Neutral Entry", etc); for 1-Ops 
            actions and in ACTS play they can be dragged manually or 
            right+clicked for a menu of choices.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: when playing with <b>ACTS</b> and not using the module's 
            cards, the module will still <i>attempt</i> to move the action round 
            markers appropriately by interpreting what the players are doing. 
            One action that it simply cannot detect, however, is <b>Strategic
            Redeployment (SR),</b> which must be manually marked or it will go 
            undetected. 
            <br><br>
            Action round markers can <i>always</i> be manually relocated as 
            needed.
            </p>
        
        <br><br>
        <img src="mo example.png">
        <br>

<h2>8. Mandatory Offensives and "Missed MOs"</h2>
        <p>When Mandatory Offensive are rolled at the beginning of the turn, 
            they can be marked by moving the MO markers appropriately (one can
            also right-click on them and select a destination).
            <br><br> 
            <b>Missed MOs</b> can be noted by right clicking the MO marker and 
            selecting the Missed MO option, which will send a victory point 
            marker of the appropriate +1 or -1 value to the Turn Track for the 
            current turn. Missed MO markers are also available on from the 
            "Markers palette" (see section 5), or by right-clicking on an empty part
            of the Turn Track.

<h2>9. Replacement Points markers</h2> 
        <p>When a card is played as RPs, the Replacement Points markers are 
            moved automatically on the tracker. In ACTS play, the "RP's" button 
            on the main toolbar can be used to simulate the play of a card of 
            the appropriate ops value for RP's. RP markers for initially neutral 
            countries such as Italy, Bulgaria, and the US now properly stay put 
            and do not accrue RP's before the country enters the war (as marked 
            by either playing the entry card, dragging the appropriate event 
            marker to the map or turn track, or in the case of the US moving the 
            US Entry marker to the Over There box.</p>

<h2>10. Near East Restrictions</h2> 
        <p>Reminder markers have been provided to help players keep 
            track of "Near East retrictions" that allow certain actions only
            once per turn. Right-click any of the four static Near East 
            restriction markers to flip them over when each one is used in a 
            turn. They will automatically flip back to their available side when 
            the turn is advanced.</p>

        <br>
<h2>11. Reinforcements Card</h2> 
        <p><b>Reinforcement Units: </b>The Reinforcements Card from the 2018 
edition is now supported, providing useful organization and visualization for 
available armies and corps. When playing via ACTS, the easiest way to deploy 
these units is to right click on them and pick the destination from the menu 
(e.g. AH armies will offer "Vienna" and "Budapest"). Units can also be dragged 
straight to their on-map destinations if desired.

<br><br>
            <b>Events: </b>Event markers for all events that affect War Status, 
            VP, or have lingering game effects are now provided. When an event 
            marker is placed on the map (typically on the turn track, but this 
            is not required), the proper War Status, VP, and game effects will 
            be recorded and updated. If players are drawing their hands of cards 
            in the module and using the interface provided to play them, then 
            event markers will be moved automatically. When playing under 
            <b>ACTS</b>, where cards are managed on a separate website, the 
            Event Markers on the Reinforcement Cards can be right clicked to 
            send them to the turn track at the appropriate time (or they can be 
            manually dragged onto the map). This will keep the VP, War Status, 
            and so forth up to date.

<h2>12. Empty Spaces - shortcuts for adding markers</h2>
        <p>By clicking on any empty space on the map, you can select it. 
            Right clicking will display a context menu allowing common markers
            (trenches, control markers, etc) to be quickly added. The hotkeys
            listed on the context menu are also available any time an empty 
            space is selected. The boundaries of the empty space selection zones 
            intentionally come out a bit past the boundaries of the space 
            itself, so that it is usually possible to select a space even if it
            already has pieces in it. </p>

        <h2>13. "Flaring" a space to attract opponent's attention</h2>
        <p>By using <b>Ctrl+Click</b> anywhere on the map, you can send a 
            "flare", a signal to attract your opponent's attention to that 
            particular spot. A green circle will briefly appear in the relevant 
            location, indicating where you want to focus attention. If you are 
            playing online, this flare will be displayed immediately on your 
            opponent's map. If you are playing PBEM by logfiles, the flare will 
            appear when your opponent replays the logfile.
            </p>

<h2>13. Logfile Reporting</h2> 
        <p>Substantial work has been done to clean up and de-bloat the logfile, 
            to help with live and non-ACTS play. In particular units no longer 
            report cosmetic adjustments within the same space or zone (i.e. no 
            more "AH1 Budapest to Budapest" spam). Reporting has also been 
            improved for other game-state changes such as when trenches are 
            added, forts besieged, etc. </p>

<h2>14. Chess Clocks</h2> 
        <p>For those who would like to agree to time limits in a competitive 
            game, the chess clock feature is new with version 9.8. 
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking
                the chess clock button on the toolbar will reveal the two chess 
                clocks.</li>
                <li>Once play is underway, clicking one clock or the other
            will switch back and forth between the two sides.</li>
                <li>Clocks tick UP in time, not DOWN. This makes it 
                    possible to agree to any appropriate time limit, simply 
                    agree on it in advance.</li>
                <li>When the clocks are running, clicking the master "Chess 
                    Clock" icon will pause both clocks. </li>
                <li>When playing online, the timer values are kept in synch 
                    between the two players though a handshaking system.</li>
                <li>The module does not judge when "time is up", that is up 
                    to the players.</li>
                <li>Saving/Loading is fully supported: the game can be saved and 
                    resumed later, and the time clocks will remember how much 
                    time was elapsed.</li>
            </ul> </p> <br><br>

<h2>15. ACTS support - for server-based play.</h2> 
        <p>Competitive events, and players who desire more hand and dice 
            security, will want to combine use of this Vassal module with a 
            card/dice management site like ACTS (http://acts.warhorsesim.com). 
            Several features have been added to the module to facilitate this 
            mode of play: 
            <br><br>
            <img src="reservetext.png">
            <br>


                <b>Reserve Box Counts (1,1): </b>Whenever a corps is moved to or 
                from the Reserve Box, a count of that nation's RB levels of
                full- and half- strength units is given e.g. (8,0), reflecting
                the values <i>after</i> the action just taken.
            <br><br>

            <img src="deploy-a-reinf.png"> 
            <br> 
            <b>Quick Deploy: </b>From the Reinforcements Card, new armies/corps
            can be directly dispatched to their appropriate arrival points via
            the right-click menu.

            <br><br>

            <br>
                <b>Functional Event Markers: </b>Tracking War Status and VP's is 
                facilitated through the use of Event Markers (e.g. moving
                "Zimmermann Telegram" marker to the turn track or map will raise
                Allied War status by 2 and apply -1 VP). Markers are now 
                provided for all WS and VP-affecting events/penalties/etc. 
            <br><br>
            
            <img src="toolbar sample rps.png"> 
            <br> 
            <b>Quick Replacement Point tracking: </b>
            When a card is played for RP's in an ACTS game, a toolbar shortcut         
            has been provided to make tracking the RP's in Vassal         
            easier. From the toolbar's "RP's" button one can tell Vassal 
                    that one has just played e.g. "a 4-Ops card for RP's", and 
                    the RP levels will update appropriately. RP levels reset to 
                    0 whenever the turn advances.
            <br><br>
                <b>Draw All: </b>For the occasional ACTS player who would like 
                to track card 
                    plays and deck counts in Vassal, several new features have 
                    been provided, including a "Solitaire" player with access to 
                    both hands, "Draw ALL Cards" buttons, and a better zoom-out 
                    control on the hand windows. One can "Draw All" cards into 
                    the hand window for each side, and then manually organize 
                    them as they are played via ACTS.
